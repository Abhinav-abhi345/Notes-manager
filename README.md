# Notes-manager
The program offers a menu with three options: to add a new note, to view all notes, and to exit. It uses a loop for continuous interaction until the user chooses to exit. It uses FileWriter to append new notes to a file named notes.txt and uses BufferedReader with FileReader to read and display all saved notes.
